## Hi there 👋

# About Me

I am a passionate web development and design student seeking a challenging internship to enhance my skills in **HTML** 💻, **CSS** 🎨, **JavaScript** ⚙️, **React** ⚛️, and **Git** 🐙. I completed my secondary education in commercial and administrative techniques and pursued a degree in **Management Information Systems** 📊 in the DRC. Currently, I am advancing my web development studies at **DEV-ACADEMY** in New Zealand 🇳🇿.

I speak four languages: **French** 🇫🇷 (very good), **English** 🇬🇧 (good), **Lingala** 🇨🇩 (very good), and **Swahili** 🇰🇪 (very good). 

I have valuable experience working with local and international NGOs 🌍 in the DRC, which has fostered a strong team spirit and the ability to provide constructive feedback. Highly motivated to learn and adapt quickly, I am eager to collaborate within a dynamic team 🤝, contribute to innovative projects, and create exceptional user experiences. The world of tech has fascinated me since childhood, and I am excited to embrace new challenges and opportunities to grow as a proficient web developer and designer 🚀.
