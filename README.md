## Hi there 👋

I am a passionate web development and design student actively seeking a challenging internship to enhance my skills in **HTML** 💻, **CSS** 🎨, **JavaScript** ⚙️, **React** ⚛️, and **Git** 🐙. After completing my secondary education in commercial and administrative techniques, I earned a degree in **Management Information Systems** 📊 in the DRC. Currently, I am expanding my web development expertise at **DEV-ACADEMY** in New Zealand 🇳🇿.

I am fluent in **French** 🇫🇷 (very good), **English** 🇬🇧 (good), **Lingala** 🇨🇩 (very good), and **Swahili** 🇰🇪 (very good), allowing me to thrive in diverse, multicultural environments. My experience working with local and international NGOs 🌍 in the DRC has strengthened my teamwork skills and taught me the importance of constructive feedback.

I am highly motivated to learn and adapt quickly, eager to collaborate with dynamic teams 🤝, and committed to contributing to innovative projects that create exceptional user experiences. The tech world has fascinated me since childhood, fueling my ambition to tackle new challenges and grow into a proficient web developer and designer 🚀. I look forward to making a significant impact while honing my technical abilities.
