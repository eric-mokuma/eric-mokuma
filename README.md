## Hi there 👋

I'm a passionate web development and design student actively seeking a challenging internship to enhance my skills in HTML 💻, CSS 🎨, JavaScript ⚙️, React ⚛️, and Git 🐙. After completing my secondary education in commercial and administrative techniques, I earned a degree in Management Information Systems 📊 in the DRC. Currently, I’m expanding my web development expertise at DEV-ACADEMY in New Zealand 🇳🇿.

In addition to my tech journey, I love exploring the world through travel 🌍, immersing myself in new cultures, and discovering unique experiences. Gaming 🎮 is another passion of mine; it not only fuels my creativity but also sharpens my problem-solving skills. When I'm not coding, you’ll find me engaging in sports 🏅, which keeps me active and focused, or enjoying films and music 🎬🎶, both of which inspire my design aesthetic.

I am fluent in French 🇫🇷, English 🇬🇧, Lingala 🇨🇩, and Swahili 🇰🇪, which allows me to thrive in diverse, multicultural environments. My experience working with local and international NGOs has strengthened my teamwork skills and taught me the importance of constructive feedback.

I’m highly motivated to learn and adapt quickly, eager to collaborate with dynamic teams 🤝, and committed to contributing to innovative projects that create exceptional user experiences. The tech world has fascinated me since childhood, fueling my ambition to tackle new challenges and grow into a proficient web developer and designer 🚀. I look forward to making a significant impact while honing my technical abilities.
